    Description: "Have you ever wanted to make a game where players could start a task, and then log out, and have it still go while they are offline?  Maybe you want them to grow crops.  Or have a daily login bonus.  Or give the player a real-world-time deadline to finish a quest?\r\n\r\nThis is the library for you!\r\n\r\nSet timers for as long as you like, and have them saved with player storage, and restored when they log back in! \r\n\r\nIncludes a sample and full documentation.\r\n"
